well hello there! Thanks to my good friend that looks like a 20 year old man but is in 10th grade who likes undertale and little kids, (no diddy) I now am able to get back

The process to get past it takes like a minuite minimum which is a long time considering the legends like Nfriendly node, Incognito, Amythest, Doge, Rammerhead, and so on. 
The intresting thing about this situation is that this is actually an intigrated thing in google. The intresing thing is this:
1. Blocking the workaround means blocking google sign in, so I'm curious on how the school is going to handle this. Maybe those shitty students are on to something...
