> 12/18/24 at 1:36 pm: well that was fun! as of six minuites ago, our school blocked all github links.
> Among the many reasons this is bad, github was the last place that actually good games and things got hosted. And as far as
> unblockers go,  last year, the school switched from having every link unblocked, and manually blocking them, to only
> automatically having some certain types of links unblocked, and blocking any unknown links, so no using links like
> "https://physics-class.panel-laboralcj.gob.mx/" or "https://statisticsanddataanalysis.sistemasfenix.cl/".
> As of this very second, I just

> google sign in, which is normally unacsessable. So what I have gathered from this is that some shitty students who wanted to watch
> youtube viedos that they couldn't watch normally decided to spread that method all around the school, and got github blocked.
> Github dev still works, but now, all github io links are blocked too. That was our last hope. If anyone knows how to deploy

> okay... so I thought I had a foolproof way to keep my eagler open a bit longer, but my screen keeps randomly switching to the tab,
> trying to redirect me to the "this page is blocked" page. the only reason why eagler survived was beacuse It has the "are you sure
> you want to reload" prompt, which saved it from the filter, but I was typing this with spaces, and space is used as the equivelent
> of a press, as far as button elements go, and I accidently preseed space when it switched, and It closed. The good news is that I
> constantly backup my worlds, and when I saw everything else got blocked, I premptivley backed it up, so I didn't lose anything.
> Anyways, I'm sure I'll find a way around it. If anyone knows how to deploy my current project in the repository "ilikewindws", on
> a site with a name that Isn't github.io (withought paying), please feel free to email me at jawndough56@gmail.com.
