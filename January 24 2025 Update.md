Hello! I just wanted to make a quick log about something that JUST got changed, from what I can tell. So as I said a bit ago, my school blocked github, but just now, I accedently opened a github link, and it worked, so this means I can use github again! yay! no more bypassing. It is very rare for my school to undo a block, but I'm glad they did. This is going to make my life a lot easier. Also, I just checked, and the majority of github.io links are still blocked. Edit: ok lol they only unblocked the main page and not the login? what? Back to bypassing!
